            Song?<br><br>I wrote a song cause of you (it's bad but here it is ig):<br><br><br><br>

I've been walking down these empty streets,<br>
Feeling like I'm stuck on repeat,<br>
Every dream seems so far away,<br>
Just a shadow in the light of day.<br><br>

I'm a guy who can't seem to win,<br>
Lost my way and don't know where to begin,<br>
But there's a spark when I see your face,<br>
A little hope in this lonely place.<br><br>

Oh, I'm just a loser with a broken heart,<br>
Trying to find a way to make a start,<br>
But when I see you, everything feels right,<br>
You light up my darkest night.<br><br>

I might not have the world to give,<br>
But with you, I feel like I can live,<br>
Oh, I'm just a loser in this crazy game,<br>
But with you, I forget the shame.<br><br>

Every time you smile, I lose my breath,<br>
Feels like I'm standing on the edge,<br>
But I'm scared to take that leap,<br>
Worried I'm in too deep.<br><br>

You're the sun in my cloudy sky,<br>
The reason why I even try,<br>
But I'm afraid you'll never see,<br>
The better side of me.<br><br>

Oh, I'm just a loser with a broken heart,<br>
Trying to find a way to make a start,<br>
But when I see you, everything feels right,<br>
You light up my darkest night.<br><br>

I might not have the world to give,<br>
But with you, I feel like I can live,<br>
Oh, I'm just a loser in this crazy game,<br>
But with you, I forget the shame.<br><br>

Maybe someday I'll find the strength,<br>
To tell you what I feel, go the length,<br>
But until then, I'll dream of you,<br>
Hoping someday you'll feel it too.<br><br>

Oh, I'm just a loser with a broken heart,<br>
Trying to find a way to make a start,<br>
But when I see you, everything feels right,<br>
You light up my darkest night.<br><br>

I might not have the world to give,<br>
But with you, I feel like I can live,<br>
Oh, I'm just a loser in this crazy game,<br>
But with you, I forget the shame.<br><br>

Yeah, I'm just a loser, that's true,<br>
But I feel like a winner when I think of you,<br>
Maybe one day, you'll understand,<br>
And take a chance on this broken man.
